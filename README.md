# GameOfLife
This is a simulation-game based on ConwayÂ´s Game of Life. It has a graphical user interface.
The game takes place on a two dimensional grid where each box represents a cell. 

The cells are subject to the following ruleset:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
